\section{Introduction}
Basic logic gates AND,OR,NOT,XOR,NAND,NOT,XNOR are designed
\section{Tools/Software used}
Xilinx Vivado
\section{Description}
{\textbf{AND Gate:} It takes two inputs and produce one output.Output  is high only when both inputs are high}\\
{\textbf{OR Gate:} It takes two inputs and produce one output.Output is high only when one of inputs is high}\\
{\textbf{NAND Gate:}} It takes two inputs and produce one output.Output is high only when one of  inputs is  low\\
{\textbf{NOR Gate:}} It takes two inputs and produce one output.Output is low only when both inputs are high\\
{\textbf{XOR Gate:}} It takes two inputs and produce one output.Output is high only when number of high inputs are odd\\
{\textbf{NOT Gate:}} It takes one input and produce one output.Output is high only when input is low and low when input is high\\
{\textbf{XNOR Gate:}} It takes two inputs and produce one output.Output is high only when number of higher inputs are even\\
\section{What I have done at this level?}
